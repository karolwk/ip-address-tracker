## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - For testing
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com)

### What I learned

To complete this project, I used for the first time three libraries: Styled Components, Redux Toolkit and Material UI. I really liked the third one, and I'm sure that next project I will make with much heavier use of it. It was also good learning experience to write mocked API tests with RTL.
